## GotCHA Integration

The following callbacks are utilized for CAPTCHA verification:

```typescript
const handleGameCaptcha = async (gameStatus: string) => {
  if (gameStatus === "lost") {
    await onChallengeResponse(false); // failed challenge
  } else if (gameStatus === "won") {
    await onChallengeResponse(true); // successful challenge
  } else if (gameStatus === "expired") {
    await onChallengeExpired(); // challenge expired
  }
};
```
