## Overview
This project aims to create a dynamic and engaging CAPTCHA game to secure crypto faucet and airdrop claims. With the rise of AI models capable of predicting and bypassing traditional CAPTCHAs, there is a pressing need for innovative approaches to ensure the integrity of online transactions. The game will be built using the **GotCHA interface**, leveraging its robust tools to introduce unpredictability and security while maintaining an enjoyable user experience.

## Key Features
- **AI-Resistant Challenges**: Introduce dynamic and unpredictable CAPTCHA tasks to outsmart AI models trained to exploit static CAPTCHAs.  
- **Mouse-Driven Gameplay**: Ensure all interactions mimic typical CAPTCHA behaviour with intuitive, mouse-based controls.  
Integration with GotCHA: Use the GotCHA widget library for seamless implementation and adherence to best practices.  
- **Lightweight Design**: Build a fast, efficient game optimized for web use, ensuring accessibility for users across devices.  

1. **Game Design**  
- The game is designed to provide an engaging and challenging experience while ensuring CAPTCHA functionality. The theme centres around a knight who starts at one corner of a matrix and must navigate to the castle located at the opposite corner. The narrow path consists of tiles that disappear at random, adding urgency and strategy to the gameplay. Surrounding the path is a sea of lava, and the player must carefully navigate to avoid falling and complete the journey to the castle.
